# Integrated Water Supply System - Dhading District

## Project Overview

The Dhading District Water Supply Project is a comprehensive water infrastructure development serving 15 rural villages with a sustainable, community-managed water supply system. The project provides clean, reliable water access to over 8,500 beneficiaries.

## System Components

### 1. Source Protection
- **Spring Source**: 3 protected spring sources
- **Intake Capacity**: 50 liters per second combined
- **Source Protection**: Complete watershed management
- **Backup Sources**: 2 emergency backup sources

### 2. Treatment Facilities
- **Primary Treatment**: Rapid sand filtration
- **Disinfection**: Chlorination system
- **Quality Control**: Regular testing protocols
- **Capacity**: 4,320,000 liters per day

### 3. Distribution Network
- **Total Pipeline**: 85 kilometers
- **Reservoir Tanks**: 8 community tanks (50,000L each)
- **Service Connections**: 1,200 household connections
- **Public Taps**: 45 community standposts

## Engineering Design

### Gravity Flow System
The system utilizes natural elevation differences:
- **Source Elevation**: 1,800m above sea level
- **Service Area**: 1,200-1,600m elevation
- **Pressure Management**: Pressure reducing valves
- **Energy Efficiency**: Zero energy consumption for pumping
