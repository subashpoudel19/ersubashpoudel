# Seismic Performance of Steel Truss Bridges in High-Risk Zones

## Abstract

Nepal's location in one of the world's most seismically active regions presents unique challenges for bridge infrastructure. This study evaluates the seismic performance of steel truss bridges through comprehensive analysis of existing structures and proposes enhanced design methodologies for future construction in high-risk seismic zones.

## 1. Introduction

The 2015 Gorkha earthquake in Nepal highlighted the vulnerability of existing bridge infrastructure to seismic events. Steel truss bridges, while offering advantages in terms of span capability and construction efficiency, require careful consideration of seismic design principles to ensure adequate performance during earthquake events.

### 1.1 Research Objectives
- Evaluate seismic vulnerability of existing steel truss bridges
- Develop improved design methodologies for seismic zones
- Propose retrofitting strategies for existing structures
- Validate findings through numerical modeling and field studies

### 1.2 Scope and Limitations
This study focuses on steel truss bridges with spans between 50-200 meters, typical of Nepal's infrastructure needs. The research is limited to bridges constructed using modern steel specifications and does not include historic structures with outdated materials.

## 2. Literature Review

### 2.1 Seismic Design Evolution
The evolution of seismic design codes in Nepal following major earthquake events has significantly influenced bridge design practices. International best practices from Japan, California, and New Zealand provide valuable insights for high-risk seismic zones.

### 2.2 Steel Truss Bridge Performance
Previous studies have shown that steel truss bridges generally perform well during seismic events when properly designed, with failures typically occurring at connections rather than in primary structural members.

## 3. Methodology

### 3.1 Case Study Selection
Ten steel truss bridges across Nepal were selected for detailed analysis, representing various design periods, span lengths, and construction methods.

### 3.2 Analytical Approach
- Nonlinear time-history analysis using SAP2000
- Incremental dynamic analysis (IDA)
- Fragility curve development
- Performance-based assessment

### 3.3 Field Investigation
Detailed field surveys documented existing conditions, construction details, and any seismic damage from past events.

## 4. Seismic Hazard Assessment

### 4.1 Regional Seismicity
Nepal's location along the Main Himalayan Thrust creates significant seismic risk, with ground accelerations potentially exceeding 0.5g in some regions.

### 4.2 Design Ground Motions
Site-specific ground motion parameters were developed using probabilistic seismic hazard analysis (PSHA) for each bridge location.

## 5. Structural Analysis Results

### 5.1 Linear Analysis
Initial linear analysis identified critical members and connections under design earthquake loads.

### 5.2 Nonlinear Time-History Analysis
Nonlinear analysis revealed potential failure modes and performance limitations under severe ground motions.

#### Key Findings:
- Connection flexibility significantly affects global response
- Bearing design critical for seismic performance
- Redundancy in load paths improves earthquake resistance

### 5.3 Fragility Analysis
Fragility curves were developed for different damage states:
- Slight damage (minor cracking, no structural impact)
- Moderate damage (significant cracking, reduced capacity)
- Extensive damage (major structural damage, restricted use)
- Complete damage (collapse or replacement required)

## 6. Proposed Design Enhancements

### 6.1 Connection Design
- Enhanced ductility in bolted connections
- Improved welding procedures and quality control
- Sacrificial elements for energy dissipation

### 6.2 Bearing Systems
- Seismic isolation bearing implementation
- Improved restraint systems
- Enhanced displacement capacity

### 6.3 Structural Configuration
- Optimized truss geometry for seismic resistance
- Redundant load path design
- Progressive collapse prevention

## 7. Retrofitting Strategies

### 7.1 Existing Structure Assessment
Systematic evaluation procedures for existing steel truss bridges to identify seismic vulnerabilities.

### 7.2 Retrofitting Options
- Connection strengthening techniques
- Bearing replacement and upgrade
- Supplemental damping systems
- Structural member reinforcement

### 7.3 Cost-Benefit Analysis
Economic evaluation of retrofitting options versus replacement costs, considering service life extension and risk reduction.

## 8. Case Study: Bagmati Bridge

### 8.1 Project Overview
Detailed analysis of the recently completed Bagmati Bridge, incorporating enhanced seismic design features.

### 8.2 Design Innovations
- Advanced connection details
- Seismic isolation bearings
- Performance-based design approach
- Comprehensive monitoring system

### 8.3 Performance Validation
Initial monitoring data and earthquake response validation of design assumptions.

## 9. Implementation Guidelines

### 9.1 Design Code Recommendations
Proposed modifications to existing design codes for improved seismic performance of steel truss bridges.

### 9.2 Construction Quality Control
Enhanced quality control procedures for critical seismic-resistant elements.

### 9.3 Monitoring and Maintenance
Structural health monitoring recommendations for ongoing performance assessment.

## 10. Economic Analysis

### 10.1 Life-Cycle Cost Assessment
Comprehensive economic analysis comparing conventional design with enhanced seismic design approaches.

### 10.2 Risk-Based Decision Making
Framework for evaluating seismic upgrade investments based on risk reduction and economic benefits.

## 11. Conclusions

### 11.1 Key Findings
1. Steel truss bridges can achieve excellent seismic performance with proper design
2. Connection design is critical for earthquake resistance
3. Modern seismic isolation techniques significantly improve performance
4. Retrofitting existing structures is often cost-effective compared to replacement

### 11.2 Design Recommendations
- Implement capacity design principles for connections
- Utilize seismic isolation bearings for new construction
- Develop structure-specific ground motion inputs
- Establish comprehensive monitoring programs

### 11.3 Future Research Needs
- Long-term performance monitoring of enhanced designs
- Development of simplified design procedures
- Investigation of innovative materials and systems
- Climate change impact assessment on seismic performance
